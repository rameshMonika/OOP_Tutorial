I have created main class that instantiate the mammal dog, reptile snake and bird parrot.

I have created the base class 'LivingBeign' encompeassing common attributes such as 'name','age', and 'health_status'


I have created the Animal class which inherits from base class LivingBeign which includes mehtods 'feed()' and "make_sound()"

I have implemented Mammal,bird and reptile sub class to inherit from Animal class

I have created a class called habitat and have a method called simulateEnvironment().

I have made Animal class to include a reference to it's respective habitat. When an animal is instantiated, it is assigned to 
appropriate habitat based on it's type.


I have created the Behavior class to define perform_behaviour(). To show polymorphism.
