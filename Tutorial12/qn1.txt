1. Write a short passage, describe what is Encapsulation in OOP. Illustrate it with
an example of “Library (physical library where we go to borrow books)”.

Encapsulation in OOP involves bundling data and methods within a class and restricting access to the object's internal state. In a Library example, it ensures that details of book storage and management are hidden. For instance, a Library class might encapsulate book data and methods like adding or displaying books. This protects internal details from external interference, promoting code maintainability and security.
